1. I have created this Personality Assessment System with Python as backend. I have used a SQLite database.
2. In Database folder, "personality_database.db" database is present.
3. Also, a "User data.csv" file is there which has 3 columns : Username, Name and Password.
Please add new candidate's details in the csv file and run Assessment test for the candidate.
4. To run this project, open root directory of this project in command prompt. Then write python app.py  and press Enter.
5. The local server will start and the application will open in a browser.
6. Candidate could login via credentials from User data.csv
7. Admin/ HR could login with credentials : Username = Admin and password = abcd@1234
8. Candidate could run personality test for himself/ herself only and the scores will be saved into the database..
9. Everytime the candidate runs test, the previous scores are updated in database against his/ her username.
10. But Admin could see anyone's previously submitted test results.
11. I have shown interactive bar plot and a static radar chart in the dashboard.
12. Also, candidate could see his/ her Strength, Weakness and Suggestion for the purpose of improvement.
13. Admin could see Characteristics, Strength and Recommendation for a candidate which will help in analysing which candidate is more suitable for a role.
